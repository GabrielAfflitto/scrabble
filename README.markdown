Weâ€™ve created a starter repo for this diagnostic with some of the grunt work taken care of. Begin by cloning the repo from GitHub and running bundle to install dependencies:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/turingschool/scrabble
$ cd scrabble
$ bundle
```
At a high level, you will be adding to an existing `Scrabble` class to make it so that it can score words.
Your class should implement the interaction pattern below to score a word, score a word with letter multipliers, and score word with word multipliers.
Note: a double letter score in Scrabble is dependent on the position of a letter on the board. The arrays passed to `#score_with_multipliers` indicate the multiplier for a letter in the corresponding position of the word that is passed as the first argument.
```
> game = Scrabble.new
=> ...
> game.score("hello")
=> 8
> game.score("")
=> 0
> game.score(nil)
=> 0
> game.score_with_multipliers('hello', [1,2,1,1,1])
=> 9
> game.score_with_multipliers('hello', [1,2,1,1,1], 2)
=> 18
> game.score_with_multipliers('sparkle', [1,2,1,3,1,2,1], 2)
=> 58
```
Use the existing `point_values` method in the `Scrabble` class as a source for each letter's value.
It is expected that you will add to the existing tests in `test/scrabble_test.rb`.
## Evaluation Rubric
### 1. Ruby Syntax & Style
* 4:  Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring
* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
* 2:  Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring
* 1:  Application generates syntax error or crashes during execution
### 2. Breaking Logic into Components
* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility
* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP
* 2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear
* 1: Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together
### 3. Test-Driven Development
* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data
* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality
* 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient
* 1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD
### 4. Functional Expectations
* 4: Application meets all requirements, and implements one extension properly.
* 3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.
* 2: Application runs, but does not work properly, or does not meet specifications.
* 1: Application does not run, crashes on start.
### 5. Version Control
* 4: Student demonstrates strong git workflow, commits frequently to document progress, uses commits to identify added functionality, and utilizes pull requests for communication and feedback
* 3: Student utilizes git workflow essentials, committing frequently to document progress
* 2: Student adds and commits infrequently and pushes project to GitHub
* 1: Student makes an initial commit and pushes project to GitHub
